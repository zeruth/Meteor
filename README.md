# Meteor-225

A Kotlin/Compose client built around [Lost-City/Client](https://github.com/2004Scape/Client)  
[Android port](https://github.com/zeruth/meteor-android)  

![image](https://github.com/zeruth/Meteor/assets/2943260/ceb94f91-15bd-4234-a16c-c9eddea55da3)

Enhancements are nice, but I intend to respect the experience, and the developers of Lost-City.  
    
```
Forbidden features (unless otherwise permitted by Lost-City):  
    artificial input of any kind  
    pvp context-aware content (ie. effect timers, hiding friends, etc)
    camera zoom / middle mouse rotate  
    menu entry swapping (including changing menu entry text)
    overlays alerting when to move / pray etc

    Per Pazaz:
    "in general: donâ€™t give yourself an advantage that forces a new meta on the community.
        The original experience should be a viable option for people to play with"
```

```
Improved RuneLite Injector  
    Inject to deob instead of vanilla, great for debugging
Kotlin/Compose framework:
    client module is entirely Kotlin, and entirely Compose - No Java / Swing in the frontend
    Many systems improved / modernized to benefit from this
Compose only UI/Overlays:
    Overlays are native resolution regardless of rs stretching
    Overlays are rendered on compose UI thread, client thread won't starve because of drawing
```
  
Depends on the following sub-projects:  
[Annotations](https://www.github.com/zeruth/annotations)  runelite deobfuscation/mixin annotations  
[Eventbus](https://www.github.com/zeruth/eventbus)  kotlin coroutines based eventbus  
[Injector](https://www.github.com/zeruth/injector)  packs `api`/`api-rs`/`mixins` into `rs2`  
[Logger](https://www.github.com/zeruth/logger)  pretty logger  
  
* `/api` restricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/api-rs` unrestricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/client` pure kotlin / compose 3pc
* `/mixins` code to be packed/modified in `rs2`
* `/rs2` aka deob aka 2004Scape Client aka Client1 aka vanilla

The injector has a handful of improvements over RuneLite/OpenOSRSs releases.
```
-targets rs2 instead of mapping against vanilla jar  
  (changes made in rs2 are injected on build)
  (rs2 is debuggable with breakpoints etc after injection)  
-can handle targets with packages  
-various bytecode fixes  
-virtually annotate members 
  (no need to annotate anything in rs2)  
```
  
# 2004Scape Client

Status: **Completely renamed!** There's no obfuscation or unnamed classes/methods/fields/variables left.

The TeaVM webclient is in the `webclient` branch until it can be made compatible with this new branch: see https://github.com/2004scape/Client/tree/webclient

Thanks to these individuals' projects for shedding light on some things - this would've taken a lot longer to complete without their efforts.
